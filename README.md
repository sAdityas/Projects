# Mini Projects!

Welcome to my collection of Python-based projects. This repository showcases various scripts and utilities I've developed to solve different problems and demonstrate my coding skills.

## ðŸ§° Projects Overview

### 1. Employee Management System

A console-based application to manage employee records using a MySQL database.

* **Features**:

  * Connects to a MySQL database.
  * Allows insertion and retrieval of employee records.

  * Ensure MySQL Server is running.
  * Create a database named `emp`.
  * Install required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install mysql-connector-python
    ```
  * Run the script:

    ```bash
    python employee_management.py
    ```

### 2. Linked List Utilities

A collection of scripts demonstrating various operations on linked lists.

* **Scripts**:

  * `LinkedList.py`: Basic linked list implementation.
  * `GetatIndexLinkedList.py`: Retrieve element at a specific index.
  * `mergeLinkedList.py`: Merge two sorted linked lists.
  * `compareLinkedList.py`: Compare two linked lists for equality.
  * `RemoveDuplicates.py`: Remove duplicate elements from a linked list.
  * `IntegrityCheck.py`: Check the integrity of a linked list.
  * `database.py`: Database operations related to linked lists.
  * `hackerrank.py`: Solutions to linked list problems from HackerRank.

### 3. Comment Analyzer (GAPI)

A script that analyzes comments using the Google API.

* **Features**:

  * Fetches comments from a specified source.
  * Analyzes sentiment and provides insights.

    ```
  * Run the script:

    ```bash
    python CommentAnalyzer(GAPI).py
